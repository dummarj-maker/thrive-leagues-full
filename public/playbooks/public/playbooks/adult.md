# Thrive Leagues Playbook (Adult)

## What Thrive Is
Thrive Leagues is a family game built around drafts, challenges, points, and accountability.

## Core Rules (Stage 2)
- We draft categories.
- Each category produces challenges.
- Challenges are completed, verified, and scored.
- Swaps/Super Swaps (if enabled) change assignments under defined limits.

## Draft Format
- Snake draft.
- Teams draft the OTHER team's categories to prevent overlap.
- First pick = other team’s hard category.
- Continue: hard → medium → easy (as defined in your system).

## Scoring (Placeholder)
- Level 1 challenges are short and accessible.
- Points are awarded when completed and verified.

## Verification (Placeholder)
- Adult(s) verify kid completions.
- Kids can verify adult completions (if you allow it) or adult-only verification.

## Notes
This file is the canonical “commissioner / adult” language.
