The Thrive Leagues Playbook (Kids Edition)
For Kids Ages 5 and Up

What Is Thrive Leagues?
Thrive Leagues is a game your family plays together to help everyone grow.
It helps us:
Try our best


Help each other


Learn new habits


Get a little better every day


Thrive is not about being perfect.
 It’s about trying, learning, and doing it together.
Our family plays Thrive because we believe we are:
Better Together.

What Thrive Is (and What It Isn’t)
What Thrive Is
A family game


A way to practice good habits


A place to encourage each other


A chance to grow together


What Thrive Is Not
A test


A punishment


A way to embarrass anyone


A way to prove who is “better”


Everyone is learning. Everyone is growing.

How the Game Works
Each week, you will be on a team with another family member.
Together, you will try to complete:
One easy challenge


One medium challenge


One hard challenge


You earn points by trying your best and finishing your challenges.
You and your teammate help each other.
 If one person struggles, the other helps.

Trying Matters More Than Winning
In Thrive Leagues:
Trying your best matters more than winning


Helping others matters more than points


Learning matters more than being perfect


Sometimes you will win.
 Sometimes someone else will win.
The most important thing is that everyone grows.

Being a Good Teammate
Good teammates:
Encourage each other


Say kind and helpful words


Celebrate effort


Help when someone is struggling


Bad teammates:
Make fun of others


Lie about finishing challenges


Brag to hurt feelings


Try to win at all costs


We want to be teammates who help each other succeed.

Honesty and Effort
In Thrive Leagues:
You should always tell the truth


You should always try your best


Shortcuts and cheating are not okay


Doing the work is how we grow.
Trying counts—even when something is hard.

Making Mistakes Is Okay
Everyone makes mistakes.
If you forget a challenge or don’t finish:
It’s okay


We talk about it


We learn from it


We try again next time


Mistakes help us grow.

Talking Kindly
Words are powerful.
In Thrive Leagues:
We talk kindly


We don’t yell or blame


We don’t say hurtful things


Joking is okay if it makes people feel good.
If words hurt someone’s feelings, we stop and talk about it.

Who Is the Commissioner?
The Commissioner is the person who helps run the league.
They:
Help everyone stay organized


Make decisions when needed


Make sure the game is fair


Even though the Commissioner makes final decisions, everyone’s voice matters.

Pauses and Busy Times
Sometimes life gets busy.
If that happens:
The league can take a short break


No one loses points


We start again together


Thrive is here to help us—even when life is hard.

Privacy and Sharing
What happens in Thrive Leagues belongs to your family.
You do not have to:
Share your points


Share your badges


Share your progress


You can share if you want, but no one has to.
Your hard work matters—even if only your family sees it.

Changing the Game
Families can change how they play Thrive if it helps them.
First, we learn the game.
 Then, we get better at it.
 Later, we can make changes together.
There is no “wrong” way to play Thrive if:
You try


You are honest


You help others



What Winning Really Means
Winning Thrive Leagues means:
You tried your best


You helped your family


You learned something new


You grew a little


Badges and points are fun.
 But growing together is the real win.

Our Thrive Promise
We promise to:
Try our best


Tell the truth


Encourage each other


Learn from mistakes


Grow together


Because we believe we are:
Better Together.
