# The Thrive Leagues Playbook

---

## How to Use This Playbook

This Playbook exists to help families grow together with intention. It outlines a recommended way to use Thrive Leagues, built on the belief that families thrive best when they support one another, stay accountable, and work toward growth as a team.

This is **not** a rulebook you must follow perfectly. It is a guide. It reflects a thoughtfully designed system—built around collaboration, accountability with grace, and the idea that we are **Better Together**. Families are encouraged to use it as written, adapt it where needed, or borrow the parts that best fit their household.

Thrive Leagues is designed to provide structure without pressure. The system removes ambiguity, reduces friction, and gives families a clear way to motivate one another. It is not meant to judge, compare, or label success and failure. Progress looks different in every family, and Thrive is built to respect that.

This Playbook assumes that **effort matters more than perfection**. Missed days, imperfect weeks, and learning moments are part of the process. The goal is not to be flawless—it is to stay engaged, encourage one another, and keep moving forward together.

Families should feel empowered to make Thrive their own. Rewards, milestones, season length, competitiveness, and celebrations can—and should—reflect what works best for your family. The system provides a foundation, but ownership belongs to the people using it.

The only expectation that should remain constant is the spirit behind the system:

**Better Together.**

Everything that follows—roles, points, partnerships, seasons, and celebrations—is designed to support that idea. If at any point the system stops serving your family, pause, adjust, and refocus on growth together.

This Playbook is here to help—not to control.

## Preamble

This is **Thrive Leagues**.

A system built on accountability, shared responsibility, and the belief that we build a better future by holding ourselves—and each other—to a higher standard.

**Better Together.**

---

## Article I: Purpose and Scope

### Who Thrive Is For

Thrive Leagues is for families who want to grow together into better versions of themselves.

It provides a clear, intentional way to motivate one another to be healthier, kinder, more responsible, less distracted, and more present. Thrive offers a shared framework that helps every family member pursue personal growth—together.

### What Thrive Is Not

Thrive Leagues is not a shortcut or a quick fix. It does not do the work for you.

It provides structure and guidance, but real transformation comes from consistent effort. Thrive is not focused solely on individual improvement—it is about building a shared family journey where accountability, support, and growth are experienced together.

---

## Article II: Accountability in Team-Based Play

### Clarifying “No Excuses”

In Thrive Leagues, **“no excuses”** means accountability to both yourself and your weekly partner.

Each week, partners work together to complete three challenges:
- Easy  
- Medium  
- Hard  

Both partners must complete their challenges to earn points. If one partner does not follow through, points are not earned.

This structure encourages support, reminders, and shared responsibility.

### Balancing Accountability with Grace

This system is not about blame or criticism. It is about **constructive accountability**.

Partners are expected to encourage one another, celebrate progress, and help each other succeed. Thrive emphasizes growth through support—not judgment.

---

## Article III: Participation and Roles

### Participation

Every family member participates.

Weekly rotating partnerships create shared responsibility and strengthen connections across the family.

### Commissioner Role

Each league has a **Commissioner**. The Commissioner:

- Creates and activates the league  
- Sets league parameters (season length, categories, etc.)  
- Manages participation and league operations  

The Commissioner protects the integrity of the system and holds final authority over league decisions.

### League Managers (Optional)

The Commissioner may appoint League Managers to assist with challenge review, consistency, and organization.

### Team Captain Role

Each week, one partner is randomly assigned as **Team Captain**.

The Team Captain helps keep the team motivated, positive, and engaged. This role rotates weekly so everyone has an opportunity to lead and support.

### Bye Weeks and the Referee Role

If a participant is not assigned to a team due to uneven numbers, they serve as **Referee**.

Referees provide encouragement and may petition the Commissioner if effort standards or rules are not being met.

---

## Article IV: Measurement and the Purpose of Points

### Why Points Exist

Points exist to measure **effort and progress**—not simply winning.

Families may choose to use points to set milestones, rewards, or celebrations that align with their values.

### What Points Represent

Points represent personal improvement over time. The goal is to beat your own best—not someone else’s.

### Badges

Badges recognize milestones and achievements.

They celebrate effort and growth and may be shared at the participant’s discretion.

---

## Article V: Swaps and Super Swaps

### Purpose

Swaps provide flexibility without removing accountability.

They allow participants to:
- Try a different challenge within the same category  
- Avoid repeating a recently completed challenge  
- Adjust for ability, scheduling, or family circumstances  

Unlimited swaps are not permitted. Thrive Leagues is designed to challenge participants—not eliminate difficulty.

### I. Standard Swaps

1. Each team receives **two (2)** free Swaps per week  
2. A Swap replaces a challenge with another from the same category  
3. Swapped challenges do **not** count as completed  
4. Swaps reset weekly  

### II. Additional Swaps

1. Up to **three (3)** additional Swaps may be purchased per week  
2. Cost: **$0.99 total**  
3. Purchased Swaps expire weekly  

### III. Super Swaps

1. A Super Swap allows participants to create a **custom challenge**  
2. Custom challenges must reflect meaningful effort  
3. Cost: **$3.99**  
4. A Super Swap replaces the **format**, not the expectation of effort  

### IV. Oversight

Commissioners may review, reject, or require modification of Super Swaps that undermine effort or league integrity.

### V. Guiding Principle

Swaps exist to support **consistency over perfection**.

---

## Article VI: Seasons and Reset

### Why Seasons Matter

Seasons create clear beginnings and endings, giving families time to reflect and celebrate progress.

Some families may recognize champions, while others may focus on milestones, badges, or personal achievements.

### Celebration and Flexibility

Thrive Leagues does not require a single winner.

Families may define success in ways that best reflect their values.

### The Power of a Reset

Each new season offers a fresh start—an opportunity to recommit and aim higher.

The goal is not just to compete with others, but to beat your own personal best over time.

---

## Article VII: Disputes, Conflicts, and Resolution

Disagreements are handled with the following priorities, in order:

1. Peace  
2. Fairness  
3. Growth  

All disputes must be raised privately with the Commissioner within 24 hours. The Commissioner has final authority in all decisions.

Understanding matters more than agreement. Decisions are never personal and exist to protect the system.

Dishonesty, bad faith participation, and misrepresentation of effort are non-negotiable. Points may be removed if dishonesty is discovered.

---

## Article VIII: Pauses, Opt-Outs, and Life Events

Pauses exist to protect participation during short-term disruptions.

- The Commissioner may pause the league for **exactly one (1) week**
- Progress freezes immediately upon pause
- Standings are unaffected
- League play resumes with the same partners and challenges

If absences extend beyond one week, the Commissioner should cancel the season and restart later to preserve continuity.

Thrive Leagues adapts to life—and often matters most when life is challenging.

---

## Article IX: Code of Conduct and Behavioral Expectations

Thrive Leagues expects **patience, honesty, effort, and respect**.

The following are never tolerated:
- Lying, cheating, manipulation, coercion, or misrepresentation  
- Hurtful or accusatory language, including from leadership roles  
- Abuse of authority  

Authority roles carry greater responsibility and accountability.

Thrive prioritizes:
1. Effort  
2. Outcomes  
3. Intent  

Mistakes should be addressed privately and treated as learning opportunities. The priority order is conversation, then correction, then consequence.

Repeated negative behavior may result in removal from future leagues.

Thrive should feel collaborative, inclusive, and supportive—**never authoritarian**.

---

## Article X: Privacy and Data Expectations

Growth is a process, not a product.

Protection is the highest priority. Thrive Leagues and Commissioners are committed to protecting the privacy and dignity of all participants—especially children.

Sharing achievements is always optional and based on individual consent. Celebration is encouraged but never required.

One person’s success is never another person’s failure. Growth is earned through effort—not at someone else’s expense.

---

## Article XI: League Customization and Ownership

### Ownership

Each Thrive League is owned by the Commissioner, who holds final authority over league decisions, including pausing, canceling, or restarting a league.

### Consistency

The following elements remain consistent across all leagues:
- Challenge structure  
- Point values  
- Core app mechanics  

These elements provide clarity, fairness, and ease of use for all participants.

### Customization

Thrive Leagues provides a clear and intentional framework designed to support consistency, accountability, and growth.

Families are encouraged to:
- Learn the system as designed  
- Build consistency through regular participation  
- Adapt the league over time if needed to better fit their family  

Customization is part of ownership. There is no single “right” way to run a Thrive League—only a commitment to effort, participation, and growth.

### The Commissioner as Builder

Thrive Leagues is a tool.

Commissioners shape how it is used to strengthen bonds and promote growth. A tool only works when it is picked up and used with intention.

## Guiding Principle

Consistency builds progress.  
Effort creates growth.  
Structure enables freedom.  

**Better Together.**
